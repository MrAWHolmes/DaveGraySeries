This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

About to write to C:\Users\DaVader\Documents\MERN-SAIL\DaveGraySeries\03TUT[NPM]\package.json:

{
  "name": "03tut",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "npm tut",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}

Now we have a packages.json file!
npm will use this to allow faster deployes 
ot git w/o libraries that will just pull from the internet :)
